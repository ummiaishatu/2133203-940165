# Security-Vulnerability-Pen-Testing-CW

Grade: 60%
Two man coursework

This coursework involves demonstrating a security vulnerability, showing how the vulnerability can be
exploited on a technical level and demonstrating how the vulnerability can be patched.
You should (working with your partner from Coursework 1) produce a software based demonstrator for
the vulnerability you chose to explore in Coursework 1. This demonstrator should contain the vulnera-
bility you documented and allow you to illustrate an exploitation of this vulnerability. You should also
then demonstrate a patch for this vulnerability that causes your exploit to fail, or demonstrate/discuss
why a patch is not possible.
